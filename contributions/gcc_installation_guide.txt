yes i know this seems unnecessary, but for the sake of guidance, i would add this.

now you know that NanoC requires gcc and g++, here i would explain how you download gcc, first step:
    1. go to this site: https://gcc.gnu.org/
    2. get the latest version gcc (usually in available on the site)
    3. wait for installation
    4. go through installation guide, then you're finished with gcc

thats all for the tutorial lol
note: you can also get g++ compiler from the site too
