# the README-WIN16

## information

here i would be explaining what each folder does. (for your info)

## folders

## the main folder (/win32)

here this stores: libnano.dll, Makefile, loader.c, and every other stuff in win32 (if there is in the future)

## example folder (win32/example)

examples are the folders for giving examples of what .nc gui files are going to look like.

## include folder and the sub folders (win32/include)

this is... what it is, the main part of the .h files for GUI

### GUI folder (win32/include/GUI)

filled with python simulation on how the .nc gui would look like if its runnable

## src folder (win32/src)

filled with stubs, runner folder (empty files LOL), and kernels folder. too lazy to explain tho

## conclusion

thats it lol, this might be useless if you tried seeing the folders first before this markdown (spoiler alert: it is)
