# contributing to NanoC

a contribution guide is always available at: `contribution_guide.txt`.

you can contribute to NanoC in many ways, either improving documentations, optimizing some files, or just generally help the NanoC repository, if you find a typo in a documentation (either markdown or txt file) dont hesitate to correct it, go for it (for credit ofcourse) and create the github issue for this typo error, or send just a github pull request (preferably).

you can also help NanoC in many other ways, such as: improving current codebase, filling empty files, or finish unfinished files or fill it with code in order to sustain activity, and developer's pull request are really valuable contributions that decrease the burden (emptiness) on the project repository.
