# Code of Conduct (NanoC)

i am making this Code of Conduct incase of anyone trying to bypass the laws of a normal laws on a github repository. my goal is to make: sarcastic yet welcoming repository (because this is NanoC)

## NanoC standards

a good example for a do and dont is:

examples of a do's:

- be sarcastic (not in a offensive way) (this is a do)
- welcome newcomers into the repository
- accepting constructive criticism
- keep NanoC safe
- we tolerate insulting comments (if the code is horrible af)

examples of a dont's:

- racism or offending someone publicly or privately
- doxing someone (showing private informations from somebody publicly)
- submissions that are entirely AI generated whether its Devin, Claude code, Cursor Agent, Codex, GPT etc.
- PR submissions that are entirely AI generated (or majority of it contains it, including documentations and unnecessary comment amount) and it dont lead to a solution that is effective long-term.
- issue spamming (the issues tab is a standup comedy place so feel free to do anything but offending somebody)

## responsibilites???

my responsibility (and future contributors) has to enforce this code of conduct to any newcomers, i can remove, delete comments, code and useless documentations, and other contributions that doesnt follow any of the rules, i can (or we in the future) can ban anyone that has bypassed the law.

## my suggestions for newbie (newcomers)

- contributors can use AI models (Codex, Claude, etc) as "helpers" when solving an issue or a bug, but remember to double-check or test the code first then requesting a PR that you're going to submit.
- refrain from excessive unnecessary comments from AI models (usually explanation based)
- rebuild (or optimize) docs that are generated from AI
- recheck your files when giving to an AI agent (be cautious when using an AI agent)

## bugs are features (yes that is a thing... sometimes)

NanoC can spontaneously combust on whatever line your working on, but thats literally *what it is*, its a part of the charm. but when trying to report an issue, use constructive criticism (as i said before) not destructive

a good example for this issue report is:

> `some stupid error on whatever folder on whatever line its in`
> `insert stand-up comedy joke`

those are good examples of what NanoC report issue is, a destructive one is:

> `delete this repository`
> `insert really bad words here`

### actions have consequences, you screwed nano over, now you're paying for it, shame it would be the last thing on your mind. (insert something here)

breaking code of conduct will result in 3 things:

- a `sudo rm -rf /` on you (aka getting banned)
- a `segfault (0xFFFFFF) on user` (warning)
- and finally: `insert warning here` (first warning)

## scope size of code of conduct

if you fork, this rule applies, ANYWHERE.

at the end, NanoC is just hobby project, but with limitations (i can agree that no ones gonna contribute to this LOL)
