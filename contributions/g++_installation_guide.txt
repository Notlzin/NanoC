now this is like the exact same, because via the gnu compiler collection site, you can also get yourself g++ compiler

heres the guide (if anyones contributing... if theres any, you can optimize it to be newbie-friendly)
    1. go to this site: https://gcc.gnu.org/
    2. get yourself the newest (if you havent already in the site already)
    3. wait for installation
    4. follow installation instructions
    5. bam, done

ok so thats it... uhh
